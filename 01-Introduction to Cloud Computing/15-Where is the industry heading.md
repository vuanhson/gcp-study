# Where is the industry heading

Think right now, a lot of enterprises are evaluating the cloud. Some are using it, some are, you know, dipping their toes. A good example is Capital One. They're trying to get rid of all their data centers and become completely born in the cloud, or cloud-native I should say. There's still a large number of people who have to learn cloud. There's still a lot of people who aren't operating in the cloud. I think only 5% of infrastructure spend, in the world, is spent on cloud. There's still this huge, avalanche of companies to come. So, still, maybe, 85-90% more companies who are going to move to cloud. There's, I think at least, 1.7 million job vacancies in cloud, right now. There just jobs that can't be filled because, everyone's moving to the cloud, but not enough engineers know how to build in the cloud. So there's a huge opportunity for everyone. The cloud excels in a lot of different areas. Cloud is infinitely scalable. You don't have to worry about running out of storage or running out of compute or anything like that. If you're using cloud correctly, it should be a lot cheaper then doing things on-prem. You don't have to worry about huge capital outlays. You know, you're basically paying by the minute, or by the hour, or by the second, or by the function, or by the invocation. So, it's great commercially. It scales infinitely. You should have very little down time if you architect it correctly.
