# What impact does the cloud have on businesses

Businesses now have access to almost infinitely scalable computing power data storage, without the need for an expensive investment upfront. They don't have that large capital expenditure to buy all this equipment in, have it sitting around for half the time where they not needing that level of capacity. They can just grab it on tap, from Amazon or a cloud provider, as they need it. That's really, really powerful for businesses. A perfect example of this is Capital One, they not trying to be a banking company, they trying to be a technology company in banking, so the reason why you should care about cloud is that most businesses are moving to become technology companies and for that, they need people who are cloud aware, who at least understand what the cloud is, and how it's going to enable their businesses.

Cloud is redefining roles in the IT industry, it's merging roles together. You think infrastructure architects, in the last few years have really had to learn, coding and scripting because their roles have been changing. So businesses can now just plug in and go and they can spend their time focused on, what differentiates them from their competitors, what provides value to their customers in the market rather than spending their time, doing the same repetitive task over and over setting up servers and setting up infrastructure.
