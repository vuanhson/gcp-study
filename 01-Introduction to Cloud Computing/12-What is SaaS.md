# What is SaaS

Software as a Service is the easiest thing to understand, if you just think about something like Gmail. With Gmail all you worry about is the actual software. You worry about your inbox, you worry about spam filters, that sort of thing. You're not worried about the underlying servers, you know. That's Google's problem. You don't have to worry about how they load balance it, how they provide high availability, how they do their DNS reading, all of that.

Software as a Service is where you just focus on the actual software itself.
