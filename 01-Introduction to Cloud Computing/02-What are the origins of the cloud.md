# What are the origins of the cloud

I think the term actually dates back to the '60s to the original ARPANET project when they were building and architecting the internet. The cloud symbol was used on their flowcharts. Whenever they would draw the internet on a flowchart, they would draw a little cloud. And the idea being there that any computer that's connected to the internet has access to that pool of computing power and data.

I think a good analogy here is like electricity. So you can generate your own electricity. You could buy a generator, you could run it in your house but it's a relatively expensive investment up front. You've got to buy that hardware, you've got to keep it running, you've got ongoing maintenance of your generator all for you to generate electricity to run your house. But if there's enough people around you all wanting access to electricity, it kind of makes sense to share that generation with everyone else. So outsource the setup and running of the generation of electricity to someone else, like an energy company, right. And then anyone who needs electricity around you, can just tap into it on demand and they can just pay for what they use. And that's, I think that's the perfect analogy
for cloud computing.

It allows the energy company to focus on delivering energy, producing energy in a really efficient, fast way and build economies of scale. And it allows the consumer of the energy to focus on.
