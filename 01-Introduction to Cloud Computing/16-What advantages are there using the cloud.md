# What advantages are there using the cloud

So things like big data and analytics require an awful lot of compute power and also an awful lot of servers, especially if you're scaling out horizontally. So if you were to do this yourself, you'd have to go out and buy these servers, you'd have to rack and stack them, power them up, and then you'd have to go through and manage them. Typically, if you're buying from HP or Dell, you're in three- to five-year contracts so it's going to be very, very expensive.

Great thing about cloud is you pay by the minute or by the hour, depending on the service, and you can go in, do your big data calculations or analytics, and as soon as you're finished, you can stop; you're not locked in to a three- to five-year contract. 

The future of cloud is it's just going to be exponential growth, definitely up until the next decade or so, as people become more and more cloud aware and more and more comfortable with moving their applications to the cloud.
