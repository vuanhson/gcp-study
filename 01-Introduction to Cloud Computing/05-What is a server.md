# What's a server

A powerful computer that you're able to access 

Typically, they're going to be rack-mounted or put into blade chassis, so they're quite flat. And they won't have a monitor that you can connect to, You have to basically connect into them remotely.

So that's all a server is. It's nothing scary, it's just a big computer, essentially.
