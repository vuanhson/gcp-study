# What is FaaS

The idea with Functions as a Service is somebody else goes out and writes a function, which you can then use. So essentially you can break down your application from these monolithic applications into something that's a lot more smaller and decoupled. So with function as a service, maybe somebody has written a function where you just take a payment. So you would then use that code and recycle that code in your own application, or maybe it's identity authorization, that sort of thing. That's what FaaS is.
