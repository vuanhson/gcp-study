# What is PaaS

Platform as a service (PaaS) or application platform as a service (aPaaS) or platform-based service is a category of cloud computing services that allows customers to provision, instantiate, run, and manage a modular bundle comprising a computing platform and one or more applications, without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching the application(s); and to allow developers to create, develop, and package such software bundles (Wikipedia)

Platform as a Service is basically something like Elastic Beanstalk. This is where you don't necessarily know what resources you need but you've just got your code and you will then use Platform as a Service to go in and provision those resources for you. Elastic Beanstalk will provision you with elastic load balances, with EC2 instances, with databases etc.

Platform as a Service, Azure was really strong in the Platform as a Service market but Elastic Beanstalk came out with Amazon. And you still have to look after the underlying assets but you don't have to worry about the provisioning of it.
