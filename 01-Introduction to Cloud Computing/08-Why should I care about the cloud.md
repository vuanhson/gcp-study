# Why should I care about the cloud

So the cloud impacts us all.

You use the cloud every day, whether you know it or not. The cloud is essentially the internet, now, so when you book an Airbnb reservation or you're using Uber, or if you're checking your Gmail or you're going to the cinema, chances are, you're interacting with one of the major cloud providers. Whether it be Amazon, whether it be Microsoft, or whether it be Google, you're pretty much touching clouds every single day in your life.

I think in five years, if you're in software development or solution architecture and you're not doing cloud, then you're not going to be too relevant in the industry. Everything's going to cloud.

There's a huge demand for cloud professionals out there. There's a massive skills gap; it is growing wider and wider. Most companies nowadays are realizing that they can no longer just be a building company or an engineering company or a property company, they need to become a technology company.
