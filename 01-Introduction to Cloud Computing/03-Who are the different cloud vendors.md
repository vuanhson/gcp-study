# Who are the different cloud vendors

So the different cloud computing vendors, the big ones, are people like Amazon, that's by far the biggest. They actually make up around 90% of the public cloud compute. They have the vast majority of the world's cloud computing capacity and the majority of the revenue and
the business. 

They're followed closely by Microsoft Azure. They actually make up the next 5%. They're winning a lot of Fortune 500 companies. A lot of corporate clients and, you know Microsoft has done a great job, you know, playing to their base and to the companies that are already using Microsoft, making it an easy transition path to the cloud.

And then the final 5% roughly is Google, IBM, Alibaba, etc 

Amazon are clearly dominating the cloud computing market space right now. But Azure is catching up. Azure has very good growth rates right now. I'd say it's, right now it's a two horse race. 

You've always got to watch Google. Google, you know a smaller player in public cloud computing right now, but Google Cloud Platform has some really strong capabilities. It's very, they're doing very well in the big data and AI space. They're kind of playing to Google's strengths. Very good at big data analysis and machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. So, that's where the world's heading so I think Google are making a smart play into the future there.
