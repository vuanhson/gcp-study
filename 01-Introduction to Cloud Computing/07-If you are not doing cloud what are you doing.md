# If you're not doing cloud, what are you doing

Cloud is where the world is going, but it's not where the world has been. So there's a lot of still legacy or existing systems that are built that are not architected for cloud, that don't run on cloud, so there's still very large existing investments Like you look at a lot of banks, got computer systems that have been running for 30, 40 years, large investments in them, and it takes a long time to change that and re-architect, move the momentum.

If you're not using the cloud, you can host your own websites on your own servers, in your own data centers, or even on your own PC, You know, you can set that up, but of course, if you want your website to be highly available, you have to build in a whole bunch of redundancy. So you have to make sure you've got redundant power supplies, redundant networking, redundant cooling, that sort of thing. And to be honest, it's just a lot easier and cheaper, to put things in the cloud and let somebody else handle that for you.

When you're using the cloud, typically, all you have to worry about is your code. Competition is driving the industry, So people's competitors are moving to cloud, they're becoming more cost effective, they're becoming more nimble, more agile, so that's driving a lot of companies, to really have to invest in cloud and not just rest on their laurels and their existing investments.

Well, if you use the cloud every day, you just probably don't realize that things like Uber, things like Airbnb-- We're seeing companies now that, think of themselves as technology companies first, and then for example, a bank second. I think that's really smart.
